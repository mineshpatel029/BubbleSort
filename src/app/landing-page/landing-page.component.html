    <p>
      Bubble Sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. It operates by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

    <h2>How Bubble Sort Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Initialization: Start at the beginning of the array.</li>
      <li>Comparison: Compare the first two adjacent elements.</li>
      <li>Swapping: If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.</li>
      <li>Iteration: Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat the comparison and swapping.</li>
      <li>Completion: Continue this process until the end of the array is reached. This completes one pass.</li>
      <li>Repetition: Repeat the entire process for the number of elements in the array minus one, as the largest elements "bubble" to the top with each pass.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This algorithm is visually appealing and can be easily demonstrated, making it a popular choice for educational purposes. It is often used to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms due to its intuitive nature.
